### Top Projects:


[__Stock Dashboard__](https://github.com/benwesson/ben_stock_dashboard)

A site where users can practice buying and selling stocks. Users can login using their gmail to save their mock portfolio. The site uses the marketstack api so the prices of the user's stocks are accuarate. In addition, the portfolio chart can track a hundred days of a stock's perfomance with accurate figures in USD. Users can own up to 4 distinct stocks and 3 seperate buy orders of a given stock. This data is stored using Neon serverless postgress and intuively interacts with my Next.js app using Prisma ORM. The site also supports langauge translation in English, Spanish and French using the next-intl library. 


[__Food Blog__](https://github.com/benwesson/ben_blog_layout)

A site where users can upload blog posts and interact with other user's post. Users can login using their gmail to see their posts and comment on others. The site uses mongodb to store text content and supabase to allow users to upload a food image to their post. The site also uses the gemini API where users can pass in their current posts to be rewritten/expanded on. The site supports search allowing suers to find post through key words.
